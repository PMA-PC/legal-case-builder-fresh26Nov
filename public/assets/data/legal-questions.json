        "question": "Describe how autism affects your ability to work",
        "answer": "Autism impacts my ability to work in several significant ways documented by my medical provider:\n\n**Sensory Processing**: High-stimulus office environments with loud noises, fluorescent lighting, and constant activity cause sensory overload, leading to cognitive fatigue and difficulty concentrating. Open-plan office layouts amplify these challenges.\n\n**Executive Functioning**: Task-switching and managing multiple competing priorities simultaneously is more challenging. I perform best with clear, written instructions and structured workflows rather than rapid verbal directions or ambiguous feedback.\n\n**Communication & Social Processing**: While I communicate effectively in writing and prepared settings, spontaneous verbal interactions, especially in large groups or under stress, can be overwhelming. This can lead to misunderstandings about my communication style or intensity.\n\n**Anxiety & Overwhelm**: Unpredictable changes, unclear expectations, or hostile interpersonal dynamics trigger severe anxiety and panic symptoms. Without accommodations to manage these triggers, I experience physical symptoms (rapid heartbeat, chest tightness, difficulty breathing) that interfere with work performance.\n\n**Pattern Recognition Strengths**: Positively, autism enhances my analytical skills, attention to detail, pattern recognition, and problem-solving abilities—traits Mark Hayes and early leadership celebrated as professional assets.\n\n*Evidence: Medical letter from Ayla Jenson Naughton, MSN, APRN, PMHNP-BC (July 1 & 29, 2025); Marriage therapy documentation (February 2025); Performance reviews 2021-2023 showing excellence with accommodations*"

        "answer": "No, I did not formally disclose my autism diagnosis to GAINSCO management before July 2025.\n\n**Pre-July 2025**: While management (particularly Mark Hayes) was aware of my communication style and personality traits, and performance reviews referenced my \"passion\" being \"misinterpreted\" or my need to work on \"patience,\" the specific medical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder was not formally disclosed.\n\n**Reasons for Delayed Disclosure**:\n1. Early in my career at GAINSCO, I did not have a formal diagnosis despite experiencing symptoms\n2. Concern about stigma and discrimination based on the hostile work environment\n3. Informal accommodations from Mark Hayes made formal disclosure seem unnecessary\n4. Fear of retaliation given the culture of discrimination I was already experiencing\n\n**July 2025 Disclosure**: I formally disclosed after obtaining medical documentation and because anxiety symptoms worsened significantly post-complaint, work environment became increasingly hostile, and I hoped formal ADA protection would prevent further retaliation.\n\n*Evidence: Performance reviews 2021-2023 (no mention of autism diagnosis); First medical letter July 1, 2025*"
