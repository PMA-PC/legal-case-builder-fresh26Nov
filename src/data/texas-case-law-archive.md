## Why These Were Replaced

These cases were **generic examples** that may or may not apply to the specific facts of Joshua Shipman v. GAINSCO. The new AI-driven system:

1. **Analyzes the actual complaints** (retaliation, ADA, pretext, etc.)
2. **Generates targeted follow-up questions** to gather more specific facts
3. **Researches case law** based on those specific facts
4. **Returns multiple cases per complaint** if relevant (not just one)
5. **Applies 85%+ relevance threshold** to ensure quality

This ensures the case law is **tailored to the actual case**, not just general examples.
