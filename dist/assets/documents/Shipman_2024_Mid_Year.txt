Here are the manager comments from your Shipman 2024 Mid-Year review, distilled for document-style clarity:
________________


Manager Comments
* Creativity:
JD is a thoughtful leader who tackles business problems creatively, constantly seeking solutions even with limited resources. He is solution-focused and brings a creative perspective to challenges like PD split, PD subro, and glass claims. The main opportunity for growth is executing more independently with less follow-up required.
* Critical Understanding:
JD understands what needs to change for business improvement. The area for growth lies in spending enough time with his team and being organized and disciplined in developing his leaders. Fast Lane quality and the closed-within-15-days metric present ongoing opportunities.
* Execution & Operational Excellence:
JD can execute at the highest level but must focus on developing his leaders. Given their inexperience, they need more support and higher expectations set for them. Avoid rationalizing lack of urgency and strive for disciplined follow-up and delivery—especially concerning team quality.
* Drive:
JD’s work ethic and desire to succeed are strong, but this can lead to taking on too much and not prioritizing the most critical tasks. Setting boundaries and focusing on what matters most will help maximize team performance.
* Perseverance:
JD perseveres through obstacles and has made improvements in areas such as centralizing MO Subro, cleaning up Subro cases, Fast Lane SDC, and onboarding team leads. The area for growth is increasing the pace of delivery and being proactive, particularly with leadership support and follow-up.
* General Feedback:
Fast Lane improvements in SDC, 24-hour contact, and 5-day liability are commendable with JD’s leadership, while 15-day closed still needs attention. Total Loss has managed pending well through the year. JD’s strengths—work ethic, willingness to learn, and desire for responsibility—should be balanced with self-awareness about personal capacity and prioritization. He needs to delegate more, focus on core duties, and support his leaders to improve key business metrics. Burnout and engagement are a concern and will be monitored closely.
* Development Plan & Outcomes:
JD should prioritize delegating, time management, setting boundaries, and focusing on the most critical tasks for business outcomes. Leading and onboarding the Fast Lane team is a top company priority. Spending more time developing leaders and engaging with key metrics will help drive better results.
