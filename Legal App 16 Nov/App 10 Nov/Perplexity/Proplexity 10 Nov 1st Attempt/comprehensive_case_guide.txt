## 1. OVERVIEW OF YOUR CASE TYPE

### Your Legal Claims
Based on the instructions provided, your case involves multiple interconnected claims:

**A. ADA Failure to Accommodate (Primary Claim)**
- You have autism (documented disability under ADA)
- You requested reasonable accommodations
- Employer failed to engage in good faith interactive process
- Employer was grossly negligent in supporting medical needs

**B. ADA Retaliation (Strong Claim)**
- You filed discrimination complaint in 2024 (protected activity)
- Employer took adverse actions immediately following complaint
- Clear temporal proximity and causal connection
- Pattern of escalating retaliation

**C. Disability Discrimination**
- Treated differently due to autism diagnosis
- Subjected to hostile work environment
- Held to standards outside pay/title band
- Ultimately terminated

**D. Hostile Work Environment**
- Workplace conditions worsened progressively after complaint
- Created intolerable working conditions
- Forced into position where severance seemed like only option

### The Compelling Narrative
Your case tells a powerful story:
- **2021-2023**: Strong leader with excellent performance reviews
- **2024 Complaint**: Filed formal discrimination complaint
- **Immediate Retaliation**: Hostile environment, reduced responsibilities
- **Accommodation Failure**: Requests ignored or inadequately addressed
- **Performance Manipulation**: Suddenly negative 2024 reviews despite no prior issues
- **Termination**: Ultimate adverse action with pretextual justification

### Key Strength: The Performance Review Contrast
The stark contrast between your 2021-2023 excellence and 2024 decline **immediately following your complaint** is powerful evidence of retaliation and pretext.

## 10. SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATION STRATEGY

### Calculating Your Case Value

**Economic Damages:**
1. **Back Pay**
   - Salary from termination date to present
   - Less interim earnings (if any)
   - Example: $[Annual Salary/12] × [Months unemployed]

2. **Front Pay**
   - Future lost earnings
   - Estimate years until you would have worked
   - Consider raises and promotions

3. **Lost Benefits**
   - Health insurance value
   - Retirement contributions
   - Other benefits

4. **Medical Expenses**
   - Therapy costs
   - Medication costs
   - Future treatment needs

**Non-Economic Damages:**
1. **Emotional Distress**
   - Pain and suffering
   - Anxiety and depression
   - Damage to relationships
   - Loss of reputation
   - Loss of enjoyment of life

**Punitive Damages:**
- Available for egregious conduct
- Meant to punish employer
- Can be substantial

### Settlement Ranges

**Your Initial Demand:**
Should be higher than what you'll accept but must be justifiable:
- Total economic damages: $[X]
- Emotional distress: $[Y]
- Punitive damages: $[Z]
- **Total Initial Demand: $[X+Y+Z]**

**Minimum Acceptable Settlement:**
Know your bottom line before negotiations:
- Must cover actual losses
- Must provide some compensation for harm suffered
- Consider non-monetary terms
- **Your Walk-Away Number: $[___]**

**Realistic Settlement Zone:**
Consider:
- Strength of evidence
- Employer's litigation costs
- Risk of going to trial
- Time value of resolution
- **Likely Settlement Range: $[X] - $[Y]**

### Settlement Components

**Monetary Terms:**
- Lump sum payment
- Structured settlement
- Payment schedule
- Tax treatment

**Non-Monetary Terms:**
- Neutral reference
- Positive reference
- Removal of negative review from file
- Agreement not to contest unemployment
- No admission of wrongdoing (standard)
- Confidentiality (negotiate limits)
- Non-disparagement (mutual)

**Policy Changes:**
- Company commits to ADA training
- Review accommodation process
- Policy improvements
- (These are harder to get but valuable)

### Negotiation Tactics

**Strengths to Emphasize:**
- Clear timeline showing retaliation
- Performance review contrast
- Documentation of accommodation failures
- Emotional impact with medical support
- Employer's legal exposure

**Responding to Common Defenses:**

**"Performance issues justified termination"**
→ Counter: "Then why no performance issues noted in 2021-2023? Why sudden problems only after complaint?"

**"We tried to accommodate"**  
→ Counter: "Show me documentation of interactive process. Show me when you met with me. Show me accommodations offered and considered."

**"Employee was difficult to work with"**
→ Counter: "Not reflected in any review before complaint. Documented excellent teamwork 2021-2023. This is pretext."

**"Too much money"**
→ Counter: "This is what I lost. This is harm you caused. Your litigation costs will exceed this. Let's resolve fairly."

### When to Accept Settlement

**Accept if:**
- Offer meets your minimum needs
- Risk of losing at trial is significant  
- Need money now
- Want to move on with life
- Offer includes meaningful non-monetary terms

**Don't Accept if:**
- Offer unreasonably low
- Evidence extremely strong
- Principle matters more than money
- Can afford to wait and litigate

### Settlement Agreement Terms to Review

**Must Include:**
- Total payment amount
- Payment schedule
- Tax treatment clarity
- Release terms (what claims are released)
- Confidentiality provisions
- Non-disparagement terms
- Reference agreement
- No admission of liability
- Enforcement provisions

**Watch Out For:**
- Overly broad releases (releasing unknown claims)
- Unconscionable confidentiality (preventing you from talking to anyone)
- Payment contingencies
- Unclear terms
- Missing promised provisions
