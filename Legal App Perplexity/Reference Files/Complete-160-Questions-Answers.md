## SECTION 1: DISABILITY & ADA COMPLIANCE

### Question 1: Describe how autism affects your ability to work

Autism impacts my ability to work in several significant ways documented by my medical provider:

**Sensory Processing**: High-stimulus office environments with loud noises, fluorescent lighting, and constant activity cause sensory overload, leading to cognitive fatigue and difficulty concentrating. Open-plan office layouts amplify these challenges.

**Executive Functioning**: Task-switching and managing multiple competing priorities simultaneously is more challenging. I perform best with clear, written instructions and structured workflows rather than rapid verbal directions or ambiguous feedback.

**Communication & Social Processing**: While I communicate effectively in writing and prepared settings, spontaneous verbal interactions, especially in large groups or under stress, can be overwhelming. This can lead to misunderstandings about my communication style or intensity.

**Anxiety & Overwhelm**: Unpredictable changes, unclear expectations, or hostile interpersonal dynamics trigger severe anxiety and panic symptoms. Without accommodations to manage these triggers, I experience physical symptoms (rapid heartbeat, chest tightness, difficulty breathing) that interfere with work performance.

**Pattern Recognition Strengths**: Positively, autism enhances my analytical skills, attention to detail, pattern recognition, and problem-solving abilities—traits Mark Hayes and early leadership celebrated as professional assets.

*Evidence: Medical letter from Ayla Jenson Naughton, MSN, APRN, PMHNP-BC (July 1 & 29, 2025); Marriage therapy documentation (February 2025); Performance reviews 2021-2023 showing excellence with accommodations*

---

### Question 2: What specific accommodations did you request in July 2025?

On July 1, 2025, I formally requested the following accommodation, documented in a medical letter from my APRN:

**PRIMARY ACCOMMODATION**: Flexible work location—specifically, the option to work from home on an as-needed basis when sensory overload, anxiety, or panic symptoms make the office environment untenable.

**SUPPORTING ACCOMMODATIONS** (discussed informally):
- Clear, written task assignments and feedback when possible
- Email communication preferred over phone calls or spontaneous meetings
- Advance notice for meetings when feasible
- Occasional quiet time to process information and recover from sensory overload

**MEDICAL JUSTIFICATION**: My APRN documented that I experience severe anxiety and panic episodes exacerbated by office environments, and that flexible work location would enable me to manage these symptoms while maintaining job performance.

*Evidence: Email dated July 1, 2025 to Scott Macduff; Medical letters dated July 1 and July 29, 2025; HR interactive process emails July 15-25, 2025*

---

### Question 3: Did you ever inform management about your autism diagnosis before July 2025?

No, I did not formally disclose my autism diagnosis to GAINSCO management before July 2025.

**Pre-July 2025**: While management (particularly Mark Hayes) was aware of my communication style and personality traits, and performance reviews referenced my "passion" being "misinterpreted" or my need to work on "patience," the specific medical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder was not formally disclosed.

**Reasons for Delayed Disclosure**:
1. Early in my career at GAINSCO, I did not have a formal diagnosis despite experiencing symptoms
2. Concern about stigma and discrimination based on the hostile work environment
3. Informal accommodations from Mark Hayes made formal disclosure seem unnecessary
4. Fear of retaliation given the culture of discrimination I was already experiencing

**July 2025 Disclosure**: I formally disclosed after obtaining medical documentation and because anxiety symptoms worsened significantly post-complaint, work environment became increasingly hostile, and I hoped formal ADA protection would prevent further retaliation.

*Evidence: Performance reviews 2021-2023 (no mention of autism diagnosis); First medical letter July 1, 2025*

---

### Question 4: What accommodations would have allowed you to perform your job effectively?

The following accommodations would have enabled me to continue performing at the "Exceeds Expectations" level:

**1. FLEXIBLE WORK LOCATION** (Requested)
- Option to work from home when anxiety/panic symptoms escalate
- Historical evidence: Successfully managed Fast Lane, Total Loss, and QRM remotely during COVID

**2. STRUCTURED COMMUNICATION**
- Written task assignments and feedback via email
- Advance meeting agendas
- Clear, documented expectations
- Reduced spontaneous phone calls

**3. PREDICTABLE ENVIRONMENT**
- Advance notice of scope changes or metric adjustments
- Consistent supervision
- Protected time for deep work

**4. SENSORY ACCOMMODATIONS** (If in office)
- Quiet workspace or private office
- Noise-canceling headphones permitted
- Reduced exposure to open-plan seating

**5. UNDERSTANDING MANAGEMENT**
- Recognition that autism-related communication differences are not "berating"
- Performance evaluation based on objective results
- Interactive process engagement

*Evidence: Under Mark Hayes (2015-2023) with informal accommodations, I achieved "Exceeds" ratings and successfully rebuilt Fast Lane after Great Resignation*

---

### Question 5: How did Mark Hayes (former supervisor) respond to your autism?

While I had not formally disclosed my autism diagnosis to Mark Hayes, his response to my autism-related traits was overwhelmingly positive:

**POSITIVE RECOGNITION**:
- 2022 Mid-Year: Rated me "4 - Exceeds" on Creativity
- 2023 Mid-Year: Rated me "4 - Exceeds" on Creativity and Critical Perspective
- Celebrated my unique problem-solving approach

**INFORMAL ACCOMMODATIONS**:
- Permitted flexible work arrangements (remote Tuesday-Thursday)
- Provided clear, structured feedback
- Recognized my "passion" as strength, though noting it could be "misinterpreted"

**LEADERSHIP ACKNOWLEDGMENT**:
- 2021: "Outstanding job rebuilding Fastlane" and "kept Total Loss together"
- Never disciplined me for communication style

**KEY QUOTE** (2023 Mid-Year): "Great job... staying ahead of volume. Passion can be misinterpreted - need to check in meetings."

*Evidence: Performance reviews 2021-2023; 2022 and 2023 mid-year competency ratings*

---

### Question 6: What specific panic/anxiety symptoms do you experience at work?

I experience the following documented symptoms:

**Physical Symptoms**:
- Rapid heartbeat/palpitations
- Chest tightness and pressure
- Shortness of breath
- Dizziness and lightheadedness
- Trembling or shaking
- Sweating
- Nausea

**Cognitive/Emotional Symptoms**:
- Difficulty concentrating or focusing
- Racing thoughts
- Feeling overwhelmed or "shutting down"
- Sense of impending doom
- Inability to process verbal information during episodes
- Emotional flooding

**Behavioral Impact**:
- Need to leave environment to recover
- Inability to participate effectively in meetings during episodes
- Reduced work capacity immediately following episodes
- Avoidance of triggering situations (which limits job function)

*Evidence: Medical documentation from APRN Ayla Jenson Naughton; Marriage therapy resources provided February 24, 2025 including "What is Anxiety.pdf" and "Coping Skills For Anxiety.pdf"*

---

### Question 7: How does the office environment trigger your anxiety?

The office environment triggers my anxiety through multiple pathways:

**Sensory Triggers**:
- Loud conversations and phone noise in open-plan layout
- Fluorescent lighting
- Constant movement and activity in peripheral vision
- Lack of quiet space to decompress

**Social/Interpersonal Triggers**:
- Hostile work environment and interpersonal conflicts
- Unpredictable interactions with management
- Fear of retaliation following complaint
- Exclusion from meetings and projects (social rejection)

**Workload/Expectations Triggers**:
- Unclear or changing expectations
- "Unobtainable metrics" referenced in complaint
- Scope reductions creating uncertainty about role
- Lack of support despite increased responsibilities

**Post-Complaint Environmental Shifts**:
- Knowledge that complaint created target on my back
- Watching comparators get promoted while I stagnate
- Denial of accommodation requests
- Termination threats (implicit through discipline escalation)

*Evidence: August 16, 2024 complaint describing hostile environment; Medical accommodation letters; 2024 mid-year review noting "burnout"; Marriage therapy initiation February 2025*

---

### Question 9: Did you provide all medical documentation requested by HR?

Yes, I provided all requested medical documentation:

**Initial Submission** (July 1, 2025):
- Medical letter from APRN Ayla Jenson Naughton
- Documented diagnosis and need for flexible work location accommodation
- Submitted to Scott Macduff (HR Manager)

**HR Response** (July 15, 2025):
- Scott Macduff requested dated letter (stalling tactic)

**Updated Submission** (July 29, 2025):
- Provided fully updated, dated medical letter addressing all HR questions
- Clarified diagnosis, functional limitations, and accommodation needs
- Fully compliant with ADA documentation requirements

**HR FAILURE**:
- Despite providing all requested documentation, HR never formally approved or denied accommodation
- No alternative accommodations suggested
- Interactive process stalled and never completed
- Terminated 7 weeks after final documentation submission without accommodation in place

*Evidence: Email chain July 1-29, 2025; Medical letters dated July 1 and July 29, 2025; No documentation exists of formal accommodation decision*

---

### Question 10: Why was flexible work location a reasonable accommodation?

Flexible work location was reasonable for multiple documented reasons:

**1. DIRECTLY ADDRESSES DISABILITY LIMITATIONS**:
- Removes sensory triggers (noise, lighting, activity) that cause panic attacks
- Provides controlled environment for anxiety management
- Enables recovery time without workplace stigma

**2. PROVEN EFFECTIVENESS**:
- Successfully worked remotely during COVID-19 (2020-2021)
- Historical Tuesday-Thursday remote arrangement was effective under Mark Hayes
- Performance reviews show "Exceeds" ratings during periods with flexible work

**3. ESSENTIAL JOB FUNCTIONS FULLY PERFORMABLE REMOTELY**:
- Claims management conducted via computer systems
- Team supervision via email, phone, video calls
- Metrics review and reporting done electronically
- No requirement for physical presence to perform core duties

**4. NO UNDUE HARDSHIP TO EMPLOYER**:
- Company already had remote work infrastructure
- Other employees worked remotely without business disruption
- My role does not require customer-facing or in-person interaction
- No additional cost to employer
- Accommodation actually increases productivity by reducing anxiety-related work disruptions

**5. EEOC GUIDANCE**:
- Flexible work location is specifically recognized as reasonable accommodation for anxiety/panic disorders
- Particularly reasonable post-COVID when remote work infrastructure normalized

*Evidence: Historical remote work success 2020-2021; Performance reviews during remote periods; Job description showing computer-based essential functions; Other employees' remote arrangements*

---

### Question 11: Could the accommodation be provided without undue hardship to GAINSCO?

Absolutely yes. There was NO undue hardship:

**INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY EXISTS**:
- Company invested in remote work technology during COVID-19
- VPN access, video conferencing, cloud-based claims systems all operational
- No additional technology investment required

**PRECEDENT ESTABLISHED**:
- I successfully worked remotely Tuesday-Thursday for extended periods
- Other employees had flexible/remote arrangements
- No evidence of business disruption from my prior remote work

**NO FINANCIAL BURDEN**:
- Accommodation costs $0 to implement
- No equipment purchases needed (I have home office setup)
- No restructuring of job duties required

**NO OPERATIONAL IMPACT**:
- Essential job functions fully performable remotely
- Team supervision effective via technology
- Metrics and reporting conducted electronically
- Customer/claimant contact already via phone/email (no in-person requirement)

**BUSINESS BENEFIT**:
- Reduced absenteeism from anxiety/panic attacks
- Increased productivity in controlled environment
- Retention of experienced employee (9+ years knowledge)

**EEOC STANDARD**:
Under EEOC guidance, "undue hardship" requires showing accommodation causes "significant difficulty or expense." GAINSCO cannot demonstrate either. The accommodation literally costs nothing and was already successfully implemented.

*Evidence: Successful remote work history; Zero evidence from employer of any hardship; Job description showing remote capability; Other employees' remote arrangements without hardship claims*

---

### Question 12: Did HR engage in the interactive process in good faith?

No. HR violated the ADA interactive process requirements:

**INTERACTIVE PROCESS FAILURES**:

**1. UNNECESSARY DELAYS**:
- July 1: Submitted complete medical letter
- July 15: HR requested "dated letter" (14-day delay)
- July 25: HR requested additional "clarification" (10 more days)
- July 29: Provided fully updated letter
- September 17: TERMINATED without ever finalizing accommodation (7 weeks later)

**2. NO MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE**:
- HR never discussed alternative accommodations
- Never explained what information was insufficient
- Never proposed trial period or modified arrangement
- Never engaged in problem-solving conversation

**3. FAILURE TO RESPOND**:
- After July 29 submission, HR went silent
- No follow-up questions
- No approval or denial
- No communication about status

**4. BAD FAITH INDICATORS**:
- Stalling tactics (repeated documentation requests)
- Termination during pending accommodation request
- No documentation of legitimate business concerns
- Comparator evidence (others given accommodations)

**EEOC STANDARD VIOLATED**:
Interactive process requires:
- Timely response ✗ (7 weeks of silence)
- Good faith dialogue ✗ (only requests for more documentation)
- Consider alternatives ✗ (no alternatives discussed)
- Document decision ✗ (no decision ever made)

**RETALIATION INFERENCE**:
Timing suggests accommodation request was used as pretext for termination rather than genuine attempt to accommodate.

*Evidence: Email timeline July-September 2025; Lack of any accommodation approval/denial documentation; Termination 7 weeks after final submission; Scott Macduff emails July 15 & 25*

---

### Question 13: What additional questions/delays did HR impose?

HR imposed multiple unnecessary delays:

**DELAY #1** (July 15, 2025):
- **Request**: Scott Macduff asked for "dated letter"
- **Problem**: Original letter was dated; this was stalling tactic
- **Impact**: 14-day delay

**DELAY #2** (July 25, 2025):
- **Request**: Additional "clarification" about diagnosis and accommodation scope
- **Problem**: APRN letter already clearly stated diagnosis (anxiety/panic disorder) and accommodation (flexible work location)
- **Impact**: Additional 4-day delay to respond

**DELAY #3** (Post-July 29, 2025):
- **Request**: NONE - HR went completely silent
- **Problem**: After I provided fully compliant updated letter addressing all questions, HR never responded
- **Impact**: 7 weeks of limbo, then termination

**TOTAL DELAY**: 
- July 1 (request) to September 17 (termination) = 78 days
- ZERO days of accommodation provided
- ZERO formal decision made

**COMPARISON TO LEGAL STANDARD**:
- EEOC guidance: "The employer should respond expeditiously to accommodation requests"
- 78 days with no decision is NOT expeditious
- Particularly egregious when employee terminated during pending request

**BAD FAITH EVIDENCE**:
- No legitimate reason given for delays
- No business necessity documented
- Pattern of avoidance rather than engagement
- Termination suggests intent was never to accommodate

*Evidence: Email chain July 1-29, 2025 showing repeated requests; Complete absence of accommodation decision documents; Termination September 17, 2025 without accommodation resolution*

---

### Question 14: Was your accommodation request denied before termination?

No formal denial was ever communicated. This is legally significant:

**PROCEDURAL VIOLATION**:
- **July 1 - September 17**: 78 days elapsed
- **No written approval**: Never received
- **No written denial**: Never received
- **No verbal decision**: Never communicated
- **Status at termination**: PENDING/UNRESOLVED

**LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE**:

**1. ADA VIOLATION**:
- Employer must make "prompt determination" on accommodation requests
- 78 days without decision violates ADA interactive process
- Terminating employee with pending accommodation = retaliation

**2. INFERENCE OF DISCRIMINATION**:
- Silence suggests unwillingness to accommodate disabled employee
- Termination avoids legal obligation to provide accommodation
- Pattern shows intent to remove disabled employee rather than accommodate

**3. FAILURE TO DOCUMENT**:
- No written analysis of undue hardship (because none exists)
- No documentation of alternative accommodations considered (because none were)
- Absence of documentation suggests employer knew accommodation was reasonable but refused

**4. RETALIATION EVIDENCE**:
- Temporal proximity: Accommodation request July 1, termination September 17 (10 weeks)
- Protected activity: Requesting ADA accommodation is protected
- Adverse action: Termination
- Causal connection: Failure to resolve accommodation followed by termination

**EEOC GUIDANCE VIOLATED**:
"Failure to respond to a reasonable accommodation request or to engage in the interactive process is a violation of the ADA."

*Evidence: Complete absence of accommodation approval/denial documentation; Email timeline showing no response after July 29; Termination September 17 with unresolved accommodation*

---

### Question 15: Did management ever suggest alternative accommodations?

No. Management never suggested any alternative accommodations:

**WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED** (per ADA requirements):
- Employer should propose alternatives if requested accommodation creates hardship
- Interactive dialogue about modified arrangements
- Trial periods to test effectiveness
- Problem-solving collaboration

**WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED**:
- ❌ No alternatives proposed
- ❌ No trial period offered
- ❌ No modification discussions
- ❌ No problem-solving conversations
- ❌ Only requests for more documentation

**POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES NEVER DISCUSSED**:
1. Part-time remote work (e.g., 2-3 days per week)
2. Flexible start/end times to avoid peak office hours
3. Private office/quiet workspace if remote not possible
4. Noise-canceling headphones and sensory accommodations
5. Reduced meeting attendance with written summaries
6. Modified supervision approach

**LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE**:
- Employer's failure to propose alternatives shows bad faith
- Suggests accommodation was not actually evaluated
- Evidence employer had no intent to accommodate
- Supports retaliation inference (wanted to terminate, not accommodate)

**CONTRAST WITH OTHER EMPLOYEES**:
- Other employees received flexible arrangements without formal process
- My disability-based request met with silence and termination
- Disparate treatment evidence

*Evidence: Complete absence of any alternative accommodation communications; Email chain shows only documentation requests, never solution proposals; Termination without ever finalizing any accommodation*
