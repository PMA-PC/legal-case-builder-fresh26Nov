## SECTION 1: DISABILITY & ADA COMPLIANCE (Q1-15)

**Q1: How does autism affect your ability to work?**
Autism impacts my sensory processing, executive functioning, and communication style. In high-stimulus office environments, I experience sensory overload, rapid fatigue, and difficulty focusing, especially during fast-paced, noisy, or highly social experiences. Task-switching, unclear directions, and ambiguous feedback can trigger anxiety or shutdown, and frequent in-person meetings without a clear agenda can be overwhelming. Despite these challenges, with structured environments and predictability, I historically excelled in my role.

**Q2: What specific accommodations did you request in July 2025?**
Requested: Flexible work location — including the option to work from home on an as-needed basis, with task assignments that match my strengths, clear written instructions, and communication by email when possible rather than phone or spontaneous meetings.

**Q3: Did you ever inform management about your autism diagnosis before July 2025?**
Yes. I informed previous supervisor Mark Hayes about my autism diagnosis informally during employment 2015-2024. Mark provided informal accommodations (flexible work arrangements, written communication preferences, advance meeting notice) that enabled my excellent performance 2021-2023. After Mark's departure (March 8, 2024) and under new leadership (Mike Parrish, Travis Cober), the supportive environment disappeared. I formalized accommodation requests in August 2024 discussion and July 2025 medical documentation when informal support ceased.

**Q4: What accommodations would have allowed you to perform your job effectively?**
Five categories of reasonable accommodations:
1. **Work Location Flexibility**: Option to work from home during high-anxiety periods or when sensory overload is severe
2. **Communication Preferences**: Written instructions for complex tasks rather than verbal-only; email communication preferred over phone calls
3. **Meeting Structure**: Advance agendas, clear objectives, and reduced spontaneous meetings
4. **Task Assignment**: Projects aligned with analytical strengths (process improvement, strategic planning) rather than high-frequency interpersonal management
5. **Workplace Environment**: Quiet workspace options, reduced sensory stimuli during focused work

**Q5: How did Mark Hayes (former supervisor) respond to your autism?**
Mark Hayes (supervisor 2015-March 2024) was exceptionally supportive. He recognized my autism-related traits as professional strengths rather than deficits. His 2023 Mid-Year Review stated: "Josh wears his passion on his sleeve and his passion for the job and the company is one of his biggest strengths." Mark provided informal accommodations including flexible work arrangements (Tuesday-Thursday remote was common), advance notice for meetings, written communication preferences, and strategic project assignments matching my analytical skills. This support enabled my consistent "Exceeds Expectations" performance ratings 2021-2023.

**Q6: What specific panic/anxiety symptoms do you experience at work?**
Physical symptoms: Rapid heartbeat, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, sweating, trembling, nausea
Cognitive symptoms: Racing thoughts, difficulty concentrating, memory problems, catastrophic thinking
Behavioral symptoms: Avoidance of triggering situations, social withdrawal, difficulty speaking in meetings
These symptoms are triggered by: hostile interpersonal dynamics, unclear expectations, sudden changes without warning, exclusion from important communications, and retaliation for protected activities

**Q7: How does the office environment trigger your anxiety?**
Sensory triggers: Open office layout with constant noise, fluorescent lighting, multiple conversations simultaneously, phone ringing, frequent interruptions
Social triggers: Large group meetings, spontaneous interactions without preparation time, hostile or passive-aggressive communication, being watched or micromanaged
Workload triggers: Unclear or changing expectations, impossible metrics, responsibilities outside scope without support, exclusion from critical information needed to perform duties

**Q8: Have you received treatment for your conditions? When?**
Yes. Established care with APRN Ayla Jenson Naughton (University Park Counseling & Testing Center) in early 2025 for anxiety/panic management. Began marriage counseling with Federico Mendez, LMFT (Intimacy Counseling & Consulting) on February 24, 2025, addressing work-related stress impact on relationship. Both providers documented work environment as primary stressor contributing to mental health deterioration.

**Q9: Did you provide all medical documentation requested by HR?**
Yes. Provided medical letter from APRN Ayla Jenson Naughton on:
- July 1, 2025: Initial accommodation request letter documenting anxiety, panic disorder, autism, and medical necessity for flexible work location
- July 29, 2025: Updated letter with additional clarification per HR requests (Scott Macduff requested additional information on July 15 and July 25)
Company had complete medical documentation establishing disability and accommodation need for 78 days before termination but never approved or denied request.

**Q10: Why was flexible work location a reasonable accommodation?**
Five legal justifications:
1. **No Cost**: Zero financial burden to company; technology infrastructure already exists from COVID remote work period
2. **Proven Effective**: Historical success with remote work arrangements under Mark Hayes; maintained excellent performance while working remotely
3. **Job Nature**: Claims management work can be performed remotely; no face-to-face customer interaction required; all work computer-based
4. **Medical Necessity**: APRN documented that accommodation would enable disability management while maintaining productivity
5. **Common Practice**: Industry standard; many claims professionals work remotely; company already had remote work policies

**Q11: Could the accommodation be provided without undue hardship to GAINSCO?**
Absolutely YES. Company is owned by State Farm (massive financial resources). Infrastructure already exists: VPN access, remote desktop, video conferencing, cloud-based systems. Multiple employees work remotely successfully. Accommodation cost: $0. Company cannot prove undue hardship - they never attempted interactive process to discuss or implement.

**Q12: Did HR engage in the interactive process in good faith?**
NO - Multiple ADA violations:
1. **78-Day Delay**: July 1 - September 17 with no decision
2. **Stalling Tactics**: Requested "dated letter" (original was dated), then "clarification," then silence
3. **No Alternative Offers**: Never proposed trial period, modified arrangement, or discussed other options
4. **Terminated During Request**: Avoided accommodation obligation by firing during unresolved request
5. **No Documentation**: No written denial, no explanation of why accommodation couldn't work, no interactive discussion

**Q13: What additional questions/delays did HR impose?**
Three documented delays:
1. **July 15, 2025**: Scott Macduff requested "dated letter" despite original July 1 letter being dated
2. **July 25, 2025**: Scott Macduff requested "additional clarification" beyond comprehensive medical documentation already provided
3. **July 29 - September 17**: Complete silence after receiving fully compliant updated letter; 7 weeks with no response before termination

**Q14: Was your accommodation request denied before termination?**
NO - This is critical ADA violation. Request was neither approved nor denied. Company maintained procedural limbo for 78 days, then terminated employment while request remained pending. This demonstrates bad faith and intentional avoidance of ADA obligations. Proper procedure requires written decision with rationale.

**Q15: Did management ever suggest alternative accommodations?**
NO. Company failed basic ADA requirements. Never proposed: trial period for flexible work, modified schedule, different workspace, assistive technology, role adjustments, or any other reasonable accommodation options. Complete failure of interactive process.
