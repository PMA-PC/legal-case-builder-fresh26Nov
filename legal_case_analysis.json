Shipman\tRequest for Formal Termination Documentation and Additional Grievances\tJoshua Shipman requests formal termination documentation (notice, reason, severance, benefits, compensation, equipment return) and formally submits additional grievances for investigation, citing \"Unfair Treatment Related to Disability and Denial of Reasonable Accommodation\" under ADA and state laws, related to medical issues.\nMon, Sep 29, 2025, 10:30 AM\tScott Macduff <scott.macduff@gainsco.com>\tJD Shipman\tRe: Request for Formal Termination Documentation and Additional Grievances\tScott Macduff (HR Manager) responds to Josh's inquiries. He clarifies termination reason was policy violation (berating direct report) discussed on Sept 17. Confirms no severance. States benefits info was emailed on Sept 17 and re-sent. Final paycheck direct deposited Sept 23. Explains unused PTO is not paid out per company policy unless legally required. FedEx label for equipment was resent. Confirms Sola Opeola will conduct an investigation into additional grievances and asks to confirm Josh's phone number.\nEmployee's Potential Claims & Company's Counterarguments (Texas Employment Law)\nWrongful Termination (Texas At-Will Employment Exceptions)\n\nEmployee's Claim:\n\nDespite Texas being an at-will employment state, my termination was wrongful because it falls under legally recognized exceptions, specifically discrimination based on disability and/or retaliation for protected activity (i.e., filing a formal complaint). The timing of the termination relative to my complaints suggests a potential link. The company's stated reason (berating a direct report) might be a pretext, especially if my behavior was influenced by my disability or if similar conduct by others went unpunished.\n\nCompany's Likely Counterargument:\n\nThe company operates under Texas at-will employment principles and can terminate employment for any non-discriminatory, non-retaliatory reason, or no reason at all. Any adverse employment action was based on legitimate, non-discriminatory business reasons (e.g., performance issues, organizational restructuring, policy violations) and was not in response to protected activity. Scott Macduff's email explicitly states the reason for termination was a clear violation of company policy regarding conduct with direct reports, which was discussed with the employee prior to the incident.\n\nDisability Discrimination and Failure to Accommodate (ADA & Texas Labor Code)\n\nEmployee's Claim:\n\nI was subjected to unfair treatment related to my disability and was denied reasonable accommodation for my medical issues, in direct violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Texas Labor Code, Chapter 21. The company's actions \"pushed\" against my medical needs, creating a discriminatory environment. The alleged policy violation might have been a manifestation of my disability, for which accommodation should have been considered, or the company failed to engage in an interactive process.\n\nCompany's Likely Counterargument:\n\nThe company denies any disability discrimination. We assert that we either provided reasonable accommodations, engaged in a good-faith interactive process to identify and implement suitable accommodations, or that any requested accommodation would have imposed an undue hardship on the business operations. Furthermore, any employment decisions impacting the employee were made independently of, and unrelated to, their disability status. The stated reason for termination relates to professional conduct, not disability.\n\nRetaliation for Protected Activity (Federal & Texas Labor Code)\n\nEmployee's Claim:\n\nI suffered retaliation, which culminated in my termination, directly after I engaged in protected activity by filing formal complaints of discrimination. This is a clear violation of both federal anti-retaliation laws and the Texas Labor Code, Chapter 21, which prohibit employers from taking adverse actions against employees who’s oppose discriminatory practices or file complaints. The termination occurring shortly after my initial complaint to HR on Aug 16, 2024, and before my additional grievances on Sep 29, 2025, establishes a temporal proximity indicative of retaliation.\n\nCompany's Likely Counterargument:\n\nThe company maintains a strict non-retaliation policy. We deny that any adverse employment action was taken because of the employee's protected complaints. The termination or other actions were based on legitimate, well-documented business reasons that predated or were independent of the complaints. Specifically, the policy violation occurred *after* the initial HR contact but was a distinct event justifying termination. The investigation into the initial complaint was ongoing and unbiased, as confirmed by Stephanie Pathak and Scott Macduff's emails.\n\nFailure to Provide Required Termination Documentation & Information (Texas Payday Law)\n\nEmployee's Claim:\n\nThe company failed to provide essential termination documentation and information in a timely manner, including official written notice of termination, the stated reason for termination, details regarding a severance package, instructions for benefits conversion (e.g., COBRA), and the status of any outstanding compensation or accrued vacation time. My request on Sep 29, 2025, shows these were still not clearly received or understood, despite the termination occurring on Sept 17. The company's multiple resends and explanations indicate an initial failure in communication.\n\nCompany's Likely Counterargument:\n\nThe company will assert that all legally required documentation and information were provided to the employee within the statutory timelines. Texas law does not mandate providing a specific \"reason\" for at-will termination in writing, nor does it require severance packages unless explicitly agreed upon. Scott Macduff's email confirms that benefits information was sent on Sept 17 and re-sent, and the FedEx label was also sent on Sept 17, indicating the company made timely efforts. Any perceived delays or lack of receipt were administrative or due to incorrect contact information initially provided by the employee, which the company actively corrected.\n\nUnpaid Wages/Benefits Claims (Texas Payday Law)\n\nEmployee's Claim:\n\nThe company failed to pay all outstanding compensation and/or accrued vacation time upon my termination, in violation of the Texas Payday Law (Texas Labor Code Chapter 61). Specifically, the company's refusal to pay out accrued and unused PTO, as stated in Scott Macduff's email, may contradict Texas Labor Code provisions or existing company practices if the policy is not uniformly applied or clearly communicated. Even if the policy exists, its enforceability under Texas law for previously accrued benefits might be challenged.\n\nCompany's Likely Counterargument:\n\nThe company affirms that all final wages, including any accrued vacation time payable under established company policy, were calculated and paid in full to the employee in accordance with the Texas Payday Law (Texas Labor Code Chapter 61). Scott Macduff's email explicitly states that the final paycheck was direct deposited on Sept 23 and cites the GAINSCO Employee Handbook policy (Page 18) which clearly states that unused PTO is not paid out upon termination unless required by applicable law, and Texas law generally does not require it.\n\nDiscriminatory Pay: User was paid unfairly based on work requested and level of work completed, not compensated at 'Manager 1' level. (Referencing relevant Texas case law examples for pay discrimination based on work requested and level of work completed, especially in comparison to a 'Manager 1' level).",
